# Hey, I’m Ritik Joshi 👋

So, here’s the rundown: I’m an AI undergraduate based in Belgium, with a strong self-taught background in Python and a focus on machine learning. My path’s been pretty relentless—definitely not linear, but always moving forward.

## 🚀 Current Focus Areas

- 🌱 Deep-diving into Python via Exercism (141 challenges, 15+ completed so far—metrics matter)
- 🤖 Prepping for a BSc in Artificial Intelligence (starts September 2025)
- 🧠 Developing solid computer science fundamentals—algorithms, systems, data science
- 📚 Systematically documenting my workflows, roadmaps, and technical notes in Notion

## 💡 Technical Interests

- 🧬 Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning frameworks
- 📊 Data Science, statistical analysis, visualization pipelines
- 🎮 Game AI (previous experience in game design; brings a unique perspective)
- 🛠️ Automation and scripting to optimize repetitive processes

## 📈 Objectives

- ✅ Complete all 141 Python Exercism challenges within a 3-month timeframe
- 🚧 Develop three production-level Python projects
- 🌐 Build a machine learning portfolio—GitHub repositories
- 📄 Launch a technical blog focused on learning strategies and growth in AI/ML
